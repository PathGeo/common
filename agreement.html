	<br>THIS SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT CONSTITUTES THE COMPLETE AND EXCLUSIVE STATEMENT OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND PATHGEO WITH RESPECT TO THE PATHGEO SERVICE AND SUPERSEDES ANY PROPOSAL OR PRIOR AGREEMENT, ORAL OR WRITTEN, AND ANY OTHER COMMUNICATIONS RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. 
	<br>
	<br>By clicking on the "Accept" button accompanying this Subscription Agreement (the "Agreement") or by using the PathGeo Services (as defined below) accompanying this Agreement, you (hereafter "Client") shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
